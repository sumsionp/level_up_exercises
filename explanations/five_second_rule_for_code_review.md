## Five Second Rule for Code Review

I couldn't find much information about this. Most of the references to the "Five Second Rule" have to do with dropping food on the ground.

Interestingly, the one reference I did find was another description of this by another student of the Level Up Rails course.

Having read what I can find and surmising some of the meaning, I would say that the rule would be something like the following:

"It should take five seconds or less for a peer to understand a small section of your code."

Or, maybe this is it:

"If your code falls on the floor, you can still use it as long as you pick it up within five seconds. Of course, your computer may now be broken, so I hope you already committed your code and pushed your changes. Otherwise, you may not be able to take advantage of this great rule of code sanitaryness."
